//You will only be turning in this file
//Your solution will be graded based on it's runtime (smaller is better), 
//the optimality of the path you return (shorter is better), and the
//number of collisions along the path (it should be 0 in all cases).

//You must provide a function with the following prototype:
// ArrayList<Integer> planPath(Vec2 startPos, Vec2 goalPos, Vec2[] centers, float[] radii, int numObstacles, Vec2[] nodePos, int numNodes);
// Where: 
//    -startPos and goalPos are 2D start and goal positions
//    -centers and radii are arrays specifying the center and radius of obstacles
//    -numObstacles specifies the number of obstacles
//    -nodePos is an array specifying the 2D position of roadmap nodes
//    -numNodes specifies the number of nodes in the PRM
// The function should return an ArrayList of node IDs (indexes into the nodePos array).
// This should provide a collision-free chain of direct paths from the start position
// to the position of each node, and finally to the goal position.
// If there is no collision-free path between the start and goal, return an ArrayList with
// the 0'th element of "-1".

// Your code can safely make the following assumptions:
//   - The function connectNeighbors() will always be called before planPath()
//   - The variable maxNumNodes has been defined as a large static int, and it will
//     always be bigger than the numNodes variable passed into planPath()
//   - None of the positions in the nodePos array will ever be inside an obstacle
//   - The start and the goal position will never be inside an obstacle

// There are many useful functions in CollisionLibrary.pde and Vec2.pde
// which you can draw on in your implementation. Please add any additional 
// functionality you need to this file (PRM.pde) for compatabilty reasons.

// Here we provide a simple PRM implementation to get you started.
// Be warned, this version has several important limitations.
// For example, it uses BFS which will not provide the shortest path.
// Also, it (wrongly) assumes the nodes closest to the start and goal
// are the best nodes to start/end on your path on. Be sure to fix 
// these and other issues as you work on this assignment. This file is
// intended to illustrate the basic set-up for the assignmtent, don't assume 
// this example funcationality is correct and end up copying it's mistakes!).



//Here, we represent our graph structure as a neighbor list
//You can use any graph representation you like

//We also want some help arrays to keep track of some information about nodes we've visited
Boolean[] visited = new Boolean[maxNumNodes]; //A list which store if a given node has been visited
int[] parent = new int[maxNumNodes]; //A list which stores the best previous node on the optimal path to reach this node

//Set which nodes are connected to which neighbors (graph edges) based on PRM rules
